The current CubeSatSim hardware is in the v1.1 folder.  The folder contains gerbers, schematics, and images of the Main, Battery, and STEM Payload boards.

Note: the only differences between the v1.1 and v1.0 hardware is a Low Pass Filter instead of a Band Pass Filter - this only affects the SMD components.

For information on building the boards, see https://cubesatsim.org/wiki.

Older beta versions of the hardware are in the other folders and should not be used.
