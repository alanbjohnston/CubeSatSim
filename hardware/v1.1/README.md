Here is information about the CubeSatSim v1.1 hardware

NOTE: The change between v1.0 and v1.1 is changing the BPF to a LPF.  Only the SMD components change - all the rest are identical

NOTE: The STEM Payload Board has a 1.1a version.  The only change is a cutout on the edge of the PCB to increase clearance for the Pi Camera.  Otherwsie, it is identical to the 1.1 version.

There are files for the main board, battery board, and STEM payload board of these types:
