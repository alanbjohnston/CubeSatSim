Here is information about the CubeSatSim v1.1 hardware

NOTE: The change between v1.0 and v1.1 is changing the BPF to a LPF.  Only the SMD components change - all the rest are identical

There are files for the main board, battery board, and STEM payload board of these types:

* cubesatsim-main-1.1_gerbers.zip  --    All gerber files used to fabricate PCBs

* cubesatsim-main-1.1_schematic.pdf --   Schematic

* cubesatsim-main-1.1_pcb.png     --   View of board

* cubesatsim-main-1.1_board_fill.png --  View of board with fill

* cubesatsim-main-1.1_topPCB.png    --   Top view of PCB generated by gerbers

* cubesatsim-main-1.1_bottomPCB.png  --  Bottom view of PCB generated by gerbers

* cubesatsim-main-1.1_tNames.pdf     --  Top outline of components

* cubesatsim-main-1.1_bNames.pdf    --   Bottom outline of components

* cubesatsim-main-1.1.mnt           --   top SMD component placement data

* cubesatsim-main-1.0.mnb           --   bottom SMD component placement data
