*_pcb.png -- View of board

*_pour.png -- View of board with fill

*_top.png -- Top view of PCB generated by gerbers

*_bottom.png -- Bottom view of PCB generated by gerbers

*_tNames.pdf -- Top outline of components

*_bNames.pdf -- Bottom outline of components

*.mnt -- top SMD component placement data

*.mnb -- bottom SMD component placement data

*_bom.csv.txt -- Bill of Materials in CSV format

I use PCBWay to fabricate PCBs https://pcbway.com
