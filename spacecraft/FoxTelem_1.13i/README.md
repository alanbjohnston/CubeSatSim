These files update the spacecraft files in FoxTelem version 1.13i or later and fix a bug in the payload altitude sensor display.

You can download them as a zip file [foxtelem_spacecraft_files.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23213090/foxtelem_spacecraft_files.zip)

Extract (unzip foxtelem_spacecraft_files) and copy into FoxTelem spacecraft folder, replacing existing files.
