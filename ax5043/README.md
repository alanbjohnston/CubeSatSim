## Overview

The AX5043 library provides an interface to program the transceiver. The library is currently configured with the following settings:

- Carrier Frequency - 435.3 MHz
- Symbol Rate - 4.8 kS/s
- Modulation - GFSK
- Transmit Deviation - 13.6 kHz
- Transmit Power - 15.0 dBm
- Receive Bandwidth - 28.2 kHz
- Encoding: HDLC with FEC
- Error Detection: CRC-16

## To Modify These Settings

The configuration files for the AX5043 are generated by software.  To change them, you will need to download
- AX8052-IDE SOFTWARE PACKAGE (WINDOWS INSTALLER)
- AX-RADIOLAB (WINDOWS INSTALLER)
They are available here https://m.onsemi.com/support/documents?type=software

Here are the basic steps:
- Run AX-RADIOLAB
- You only need to configure the PHY and Framing tabs.  Make sure you set the Fxtal to 16 MHz in the PHY tab
(if you forget, you will get AX initialization failure messages when you run your code). You can view and
change the registers by clicking the Expert Settings button.  Here's the documentation on the registers:

- When you are done, click Calculate Registers then Save and Write Output. 
- Click on the Edit Master button - this will launch Code::Blocks (if Code::Blocks is already open, you might get an error
close Code::Blocks then click on Edit Master again.)
- Open the file Sources/AX_Radio_Lab_output/config.c which has your new configuration. 
- You will need to manually copy the configuration settings to the file generated/config.c
